    description: "The first-generation Renault Symbol (also known as the Renault Clio Symbol, Renault Thalia, or Renault Clio Sedan in different markets) was essentially a sedan version of the second-generation Renault Clio. Developed primarily for markets where sedans were preferred over hatchbacks, particularly Eastern Europe, Turkey, Latin America, and North Africa, the Symbol featured a conventional three-box design extending the Clio's platform and styling. Measuring around 4.15 meters in length, it offered a spacious 510-liter trunkâ€”a significant advantage over the hatchback version. Engine options typically included small gasoline units ranging from 1.0 to 1.6 liters and the 1.5 dCi diesel, with power outputs between 60 and 107 horsepower. Transmission options were primarily 5-speed manual with some markets receiving a 4-speed automatic option. The interior was largely identical to the Clio hatchback, offering straightforward controls and reasonable equipment levels for its price point. A facelift in 2002 aligned the front-end styling more closely with the updated Clio, while maintaining the distinctive rear section. The first-generation Symbol established itself as a value-focused sedan offering reliable transportation and generous cargo space at an accessible price point, becoming particularly popular in markets where sedan body styles were traditionally preferred and where low purchase and operating costs were primary considerations."

    description: "The second-generation Renault Symbol, launched in 2008, was based on the Renault-Nissan B platform shared with the third-generation Renault Clio but featured more distinctive styling that differentiated it more clearly from its hatchback sibling. Designed specifically for emerging markets where sedans remained popular, the second-generation Symbol offered improved quality, safety, and equipment levels while maintaining its value positioning. Measuring approximately 4.26 meters in length, it provided a slightly larger cabin and a generous 506-liter trunk capacity. Engine options included 1.2-liter and 1.6-liter gasoline units and the 1.5 dCi diesel, with power outputs ranging from 75 to 105 horsepower. Transmission options included 5-speed manual and 4-speed automatic depending on the engine and market. The interior featured a more modern design with improved materials and available equipment including air conditioning, power windows, and basic audio systems, with higher trims offering features like fog lights, alloy wheels, and more comprehensive infotainment options. Safety features included dual front airbags and ABS braking, though these sometimes varied by market. The second-generation Symbol continued to appeal to budget-conscious buyers seeking the practicality of a sedan with low running costs, particularly in regions like Eastern Europe, Russia, North Africa, and Latin America."

    description: "The third-generation Renault Symbol (still marketed as Thalia in some regions) was based on the second-generation Dacia Logan but adopted Renault's then-current design language with the prominent diamond logo and more flowing lines compared to the utilitarian Logan. This generation continued the model's focus on providing affordable, practical transportation in a three-box sedan format for markets where such vehicles remained popular. Measuring approximately 4.35 meters in length, the third-generation Symbol offered increased interior space and a capacious 510-liter trunk. Engine options varied by market but typically included 1.2-liter and 1.6-liter gasoline engines and the 1.5 dCi diesel, with power outputs ranging from 75 to 105 horsepower. Transmission options included 5-speed manual and 4-speed automatic depending on the engine. The interior represented a significant step forward in design and perceived quality compared to its predecessors, with a more contemporary dashboard layout and improved materials. Available equipment expanded to include features like the Media Nav infotainment system with a 7-inch touchscreen, cruise control, rear parking sensors, and automatic climate control on higher trim levels. Safety features were enhanced with up to four airbags, electronic stability control, and emergency brake assist, though specific features varied by market. A facelift in 2016 introduced Renault's updated design language with C-shaped LED daytime running lights and minor interior refinements. The third-generation Symbol continues to serve as an important value-focused sedan in Renault's global portfolio, particularly in markets like Turkey, North Africa, and parts of Latin America and Eastern Europe where it competes in the budget sedan segment."
